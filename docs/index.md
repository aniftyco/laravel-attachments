## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
composer require aniftyco/laravel-attachments
```

### Basic Usage

Add an attachment column to your migration:

```php
Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->attachment('avatar');
    $table->timestamps();
});
```

Add the cast to your model:

```php
use NiftyCo\Attachments\Casts\AsAttachment;

class User extends Model
{
    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            'avatar' => AsAttachment::class,
        ];
    }
}
```

Upload a file:

```php
use NiftyCo\Attachments\Attachment;

$user->avatar = Attachment::fromFile($request->file('avatar'), folder: 'avatars');
$user->save();
```

Access the attachment:

```php
echo $user->avatar->url;
echo $user->avatar->readableSize();
```
